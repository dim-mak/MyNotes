## In 5 Years
I can not say that I will be in an exact position, but I am pretty sure that I will have gained more **experience** through the years. My goal is to see as many cases as possible and become better in problem solving, coding, etc. I will be able to handle deferent scenarios efficiently and face difficulties in a better way than now.

## 3 adjectives about me
* Productive
* Consistent
* Methodical

## Working Environment
* Friendly
* Evolving
* State-of-the-art
* I want an environment with good team communication and guidance. Challenges can not miss and of course goals and organization for each team member.

## Team vs Individual Working
The answer is a **combination**
* **Team** is here for providing the project strategy, guidance and always a second opinion for completing my task. Always, there must exist a level of seniority and experience amongst team members.
* As **Individual**, I am confident enough to take important decision and deliver major tasks without annoying senior engineers all the time. 

## Organization
Sometimes maybe too much.
Fun of calendar, personal notes and tasks, weekly timeline etc.

## Improving
I am in a phase of continuous improving using:
* Courses and tutorials from youtube, udemy, coursera etc.
* Personal hobbies: Projects to help my daily life (for HW: Home automation with ESP, Raspberry, Led Strips, Relays etc) 
* In Hellenic Army: Learned new technologies and frameworks like Java Spring and contributed in designing the architecture of applications

## Motive
* Small, daily but important goals
* Small braked during the day to stay untired and focused
* Organization and scheduling is the best way for me to stay motivated. It helps me focus on my current project and achieve the goal at the end. I need a perfect and clean timeline.

## Negatives of me
**Perfectionism**: It is not that big of a deal but most of the times I wanna check everything 3 and 4 times to ensure that everything is okay to be delivered. I am working this negative aspect of me and I have been improved for previous years. This feature of me acts as a helper to remind me not to miss any details and not as a downside that will keep me working after the deadline has passed.

## Pressure and Difficulties in Work
I am pretty sure that there will exist pressure moments. I am confident that I have a good understanding of feelings management, so I will stay polite and calm. In these work environments tension can not exist. Any disagreement will go away with only a polite and calm conversation inside the team. I find useful to take a step back and revaluate the situation to find a best solution.
